## 2. Concept of Regions and Availability Zones

AWS organizes its infrastructure into Regions and Availability Zones for high availability and disaster recovery:

    A[Region] --> B[Availability Zone 1]
    A --> C[Availability Zone 2]
    A --> D[Availability Zone 3]
    B --> E[EC2 Instances]
    B --> F[RDS Databases]
    C --> G[EC2 Instances]
    C --> H[RDS Databases]
    D --> I[EC2 Instances]
    D --> J[RDS Databases]

    style B,C,D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E,F,G,H,I,J fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

- **Region**: A geographical location where AWS has data centers (e.g., US East, EU West). Each region is completely independent and isolated from other regions.
- **Availability Zone**: A data center location within a region. Key characteristics:
  - Each region typically has 2-3 AZs
  - AZs are isolated from each other to prevent failures from affecting multiple zones
  - Each AZ has its own power, cooling, and networking infrastructure
  - Used for high availability by deploying applications across multiple AZs
  - AZs are connected through low-latency links for fast communication

### Practical Example: Multi-AZ Deployment
```yaml
# AWS CloudFormation Template Example
Resources:
  WebServerGroup:
    Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZones: ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
      MinSize: "2"
      MaxSize: "6"
      
  RDSInstance:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    Properties:
      MultiAZ: true
      BackupRetentionPeriod: 7
      
  LoadBalancer:
    Type: AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer
    Properties:
      Subnets:
        - subnet-1a
        - subnet-1b
        - subnet-1c
```

## 3. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains software configuration (operating system, application server, applications) for creating EC2 instances. Key aspects:

- **Components of AMI**:
  - Operating System (Linux, Windows, etc.)
  - Pre-configured software and applications
  - Data volumes
  - Security settings
  - Network configuration

- **Uses of AMI**:
  - Quick instance creation with pre-configured settings
  - Consistent environments across multiple instances
  - Backup and recovery of instances
  - Testing and development environments
  - Deployment of standardized applications
  - Migration of on-premises applications to AWS

## 4. Elastic IP vs Public IP

AWS provides two main types of IP addresses for internet connectivity:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Instance] --> B[Elastic IP]
    A --> C[Public IP]
    
    B --> D[Static]
    B --> E[Reassignable]
    B --> F[Permanently Associated]
    B --> G[Limited]
    
    C --> H[Dynamic]
    C --> I[Auto-Assigned]
    C --> J[Temporary]
    C --> K[Unlimited]
    
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

- **Elastic IP (EIP)**:
  - Static IP address that remains associated with your AWS account
  - Can be reassigned between instances
  - Maintains the same IP address even when the instance is stopped
  - Limited number per account (typically 5-20)
  - Requires explicit allocation
  - Ideal for applications that need a consistent IP address

- **Public IP**:
  - Dynamic IP address assigned automatically to instances
  - Changes when the instance is stopped and started
  - Automatically assigned to instances with public subnet
  - No limit on number of addresses
  - Suitable for temporary or development environments
  - Automatically released when instance is terminated

### Practical Example: Using Elastic IP
```bash
# Allocate an Elastic IP
aws ec2 allocate-address

# Associate with an instance
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --allocation-id eipalloc-12345678

# Disassociate from an instance
aws ec2 disassociate-address --association-id eipassoc-12345678

# Release the Elastic IP
aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id eipalloc-12345678
```
